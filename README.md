Adytor (An Audyssey ady file Editor)

This program is currently a fork of ratbuddyssey. It allows editing the ady file that is retrieved from various Denon and Marantz receivers when calibrating via the Audyssey MultEQ App. The file can be send by mail or to your google drive.

Adytor allows editing the channel data, apply target curves considering the roll-off and compensations implemented in Audyssey.
